### Project Description
Our project introduces an innovative system of smart buoys strategically positioned across the ocean. Each buoy is equipped with an array of sensors that automatically measure and record critical data from the marine and atmospheric environments. The collected data is transmitted to a central station, where it undergoes processing and analysis before being visualized through a web application. This system enables researchers, educational institutions, and policy-makers to track and analyze trends, model climate changes, and assess anthropogenic impacts on marine ecosystems with unprecedented accuracy and ease.
