### Project Description
Our project introduces an innovative system of smart buoys strategically positioned across the ocean. Each buoy is equipped with an array of sensors that automatically measure and record critical data from the marine and atmospheric environments. The collected data is transmitted to a central station, where it undergoes processing and analysis before being visualized through a web application. This system enables researchers, educational institutions, and policy-makers to track and analyze trends, model climate changes, and assess anthropogenic impacts on marine ecosystems with unprecedented accuracy and ease.

### Technologies Used
- Raspberry Pi
- Arduino
- Next.js
- Flask

This project is part of the Hack TUES hackathon, under the 'Exploring the Infinite Ocean' subtheme, aiming to contribute to marine research with cutting-edge technology.
